# Project 07: Interactive Employee Hierarchy

## Overview
This project builds on Object-Oriented Programming by combining **Inheritance** with **Dynamic User Input**. It simulates a real-world HR portal where data is collected in real-time and stored as structured objects.

## Features
- **User-Driven Creation:** No more hardcoded data. Use the CLI to create your database.
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** Different object types (Person and Employee) stored in the same list and processed with the same loop.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures data is captured correctly before creating objects.

## Technical Specs
- **Logic Flow:** `While` loop, `input()` collection, Object Creation, List appending.
- **Parent Class:** `Person` (Basic Info)
- **Child Class:** `Employee` (Professional Info)

## How to Run
```bash
python employee_interactive.py
